Variables:Containers for storing data values
EX:
print("You won", user_wins, "times.")
print("The computer won", computer_wins, "times.")
print("Goodbye!")
Lists:Store multiple items in a single variable
EX:print("You won", user_wins, "times.")

 Boolean Logic (AND, OR, etc.)
 True or False EX: user_wins += 1
  While Loops:With the while loop we can execute a set of statements as long as a condition is true.EX:while True:

   Conditional (if/else if/ else)
EX: if user_input not in options:
        continue
         else:
        print("You lost!")
        computer_wins += 1
 Optimization (clean code up and add functions):to find the best solution to a problem out of a large set of possible solutions.I had trouble with indenting which infected most of the code I needed to indent more and move some stuff around to make the code work.
